  some of the people were liars, and others always told the truth. When he met
  with one of the inhabitant of the island, he asked him: "Are you a liar or

  it is so, you'll be my companion", Robinson said. After a while they saw
  another man. Robinson pointed to the man and asked his new friend, "Could
  you, please, ask him, if he is a liar or not?" The new friend asked the

  "All right, now I'm convinced that you are not a liar!" smiled

<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><b><span lang="EN-GB">Answer</span></b></p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">Regardless of who is interrogated
  (liar or not), to the question “Are you a liar or not?” the person will answer:
  “I'm not a liar!”. Indeed, if he is not a liar, then he is telling the truth.
  If he is a liar, then he will say a lie about himself (that is, that he is not
  a liar). So, Robinson was just checking the honesty of his companion: if the
  companion was a liar, then he would lie and tell Robinson that the answer was
  “I'm a liar!”. Since the companion said that the answer was “I’m not a
  liar!", then the companion must be a truth-teller.

  planet of a certain system. He or she watches the closest planet. The number of
  planets is odd and all of the distances are different. Prove that there is one
  planet not being watched.</span>
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><b><span>Answer 1</span></b></p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><span>Start with an arbitrary planet and label it 1. Label the planet that it
  is watching as 2. Now 2 can either watch 1 or some other planet. If it watches
  1, these two form a pair that can be discarded, still leaving an odd number of
  planets, with which we start over. If 2 is watching some other planet, label it
  3. If 3 is watching 2, discard the pair and continue from 1. (Clearly now 1 is
  not being watched.) Basically we'll be left with an odd number of planets that
  don't form pairs. The first of two planets that are successively labeled
  without forming pairs, is not being watched. Since there are an odd number of
  planets, such a loner will always exist, since even if we got successive pairs
  right till the end, there would still be one 'odd' planet out. In fact, there
  can be more than one planet not being watched (If 2 &amp; 3 above were
  discarded as a pair, we would have a new arbitrary planet 2. Continuing, it is
  possible that the new 3 &amp; 4 form a pair, leaving the new 1 AND 2 not being
  watched) I'd rather not go into more cases.</span>
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><b><span>Answer 2</span></b></p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><span>Since the number of planets is odd, we can consider the number of
  planets as (2n + 1) where n is a positive integer. Now, we consider a binary
  tree (a tree whose number of children per node is at least two) where each node
  has only one child. If each node represents a planet then each edge represents
  the line of sight between two particular planets. Now, for each planet to be
  watched, the total number of edges for the binary tree with (2n + 1) nodes
  should be (2n + 1). But from graph theory, we know that a tree with M nodes
  always has (M - 1) edges. Hence, in this case, the number of edges = (2n + 1)
  –1 = 2n. Therefore, one planet is not being watched.</span>
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><b><span>Answer 3</span></b></p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><span>As a simple case, let us consider a system of five planets A, B, C, D
  and E, all in a single horizontal plane. In comparison to the position of A,
  suppose that the rest are now so standing: B to the west (1.01 miles), C to the
  east (1.02 miles), D to the north (1.03 miles), and, E to the south (1.04
  miles). Anyone who has even a little knowledge of Pythagoras will agree that A
  is the closest planet to all of the rest. Therefore, A is the centre of
  attention, keenly watched upon by the family. B is watched by A. Three planets
  (poor C, D and E) are in the same fray and have no gazers at all. Beware Rupak!
  </span>
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><span>Please do not try to argue that I have suggested an impossible planet
  system. Start by placing their sun anywhere in their same plane to your liking.
  Draw their circular path around the sun. The best excuse you can probably
  produce is that B and C (or D and E) are very nearly at the same distance from
  the sun. But you will agree that their paths are still different – though only
  by a miniscule!</span>

  a cylindrical hole, that is six inches long, through the center of a sphere,
  what is the remaining volume of the sphere? The diameter of the cylinder is not
  negligible. Explain your answer. Yes, the data is sufficient! 
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><b>Answer</b><br>
  36*pi cubic inches 
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">After writing down some funky math equations
  for the volume of a sphere with radius R, and a cylinder of height 6, and the
  volume of the 2 dome caps above and below the cylinder, all terms cancel out to
  leave 36*pi. 
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">Therefore, no matter what the radius
  of the sphere is, if you cut out a cylinder through the center such that the
  height is 6 inches, the remaining volume will always be 36*pi! 
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">Let R be the radius of the sphere. The
  radius of the cylindrical hole will then be sqrt(R^2 - 9). The height of the
  spherical caps at each end of the cylinder will be R-3. To determine what is
  left after the cylinder and the caps have been removed, we do the following: 
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">Add the volume of the cylinder
  6*PI*(R^2 - 9)<br>
  Add twice the volume of the spherical caps where the volume of a spherical cap
  is PI*A*(3r^2 + A^2)/6, where A is the altitude of the cap (R -3), and r is the
  radius of the cap, sqrt(R^2 - 9)<br>
  Subtract this from the volume of the sphere (4/3)*PI*R^3
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">You are left with 36*PI, the volume of
  the remaining solid. As you can see, the volume of this remaining solid is
  constant, regardless of the cylindrical hole's radius, or the radius of the
  sphere!

<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><b>Answer</b><br>
  The probability is 1.

<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">Thanks to John Tripp for this

</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">Let us assume that is possible for
  everyone in the world to have a different number of friends. 
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">W = World Population. </p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">Since the maximum number of
  friendships for anyone is W-1, We can enumerate the population F = 0 to W-1,
  where F will equal the number of friendships Individual member of the
  population has. 
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">So for individual 1, n=0 No
  Friendships 
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">Now the individual with no friendships
  by definition can not have any friends. But individual W will need w-1 friends.
  But the available population is only w-2, after removing individual 1(0
  Friends) and of course individual W. So assumption can not be true. Individual
  W MUST have the same number of friends as someone else. 
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">Of course, the situation becomes

  with an exceptional power: every night, they could dream about all the men,
  other than their own husband, in the country who were thieves. For example, if
  some woman dreamt about 5 men, she could not be sure about how many men were
  really thieves: it could be 5 or 6 (because she did not know anything about her
  husband). However, they could not discuss their dreams with each other because
  that was considered a taboo subject. One day, the queen of the country
  declared: "I know a number of men in the country are thieves. I want their
  wives to kill them."

  Then, his wife would not dream of any thieves on the first night. However,
  since the queen has stated that there is at least one thief in the land, she
  (the wife) would realize that her husband is a thief, and would kill him the
  next day. Thus, if there was only one thief, he would get killed on the first
  day following the proclamation. 
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">Similarly, if there were only two
  thieves, their wives would dream of only thief. So they would wait one day, and
  since nobody would get killed on the first day, they would realize that there
  has to be more than one thief, and so their own husband must be a thief. Thus,
  if there are two thieves, they would both be killed on the second day following
  the proclamation.

<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">Continuing in this manner, we see that

  What is the probability that a random chord for this circle will be have a
  length &gt; x? You must explain your answer. 
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><u>Note</u>: A <i>chord</i> is a line
  whose endpoints lie on the circumference of the circle. 
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><b>Answer</b></p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">The answer depends on the way you
  assume the chord is drawn (i.e., the distribution of the random chord). Hence
  there could be several possible solutions. Here are a few possibilities.
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">If you assume that a
  "random" chord means picking two random points along the
  circumference of the circle, then the probability is 1/3. This is because you
  can rotate the equilateral triangle until the apex lines up with the first
  point. Now if the second point lies on the circle between the other two apices,
  then the chord will be longer than x. Since the length of this region of the
  circle is 1/3 the entire circumference of the circle, the probability is 1/3.
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">If you assume that the chord is drawn by
  randomly picking a point within the area of the circle, and then treating this
  as the midpoint of the chord (a very common construction), then the probability
  is 1/4. This is because the midpoint must be within half the radius from the
  center. The probability is then, area of smaller circle / area of circle = 1/4.
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">Here is another possible solution from

  they can get ($1,000). Even if a spoiler comes along to pick B, ruining all
  A-pickers' take, that B selector comes away with nothing unless 25% of the

  One: Let the probability of everyone picking A be x. Then the probability of

  Mathematical expectation on picking A = $1000x Mathematical expectation on
  picking B &lt;= $100(4x) <br>
  Thus I can expect more if I pick A. <br>
  Two: Now that I know everyone knows the rules, I'd assume everyone wants $1000
  more than $100, and that no one wants to cut anyone else out by deliberately
  picking B. I'd feel safer picking A.</span>

<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Here is an interesting analysis by Siddhartha Mathur</span></p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Here's the mathematics behind the problem<br>
  Assume the probability that someone picks A is "x" =&gt; pr[B] =
  (1-x)<br>
  Let the total sample set be "S"<br>
  =&gt; Expected number of people picking B = (1-x)S<br>
  =&gt; Pr[ &gt;25% pick B ] &lt;= 4(1-x) { by markov's inequality }<br>
  Expected money from B &lt;= 400(1-x)<br>
  Expected money from A = 1000x^S<br>
  So, as the sample set grows bigger and bigger choosing A gets to be a worse
  option<br>
  BUT, WE REALIZE THIS IS ASSUMING A PROBABILITY GENERATOR(x) AND THIS QUESTION
  IS NOT ABOUT THAT</span>
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The question here is not as much about probability as about variance...
  a single deviation point could completely change decisions</span>
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Here is my reasoning that i adopt for choosing B</span></p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In an ideal world (define an ideal world to be composed of not only
  intelligent people, but also people that can accurately predict and trust the
  actions of others) everyone would pick A</span>
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt"><span lang="EN-GB">But, anyone that has invested in the stock market understands that
  things work out best when you think like the others (who in turn think like
  others, thereby propagating the web of trust model at an ever decreasing trust
  level) IF even one person chooses B, there is no merit to my choosing A.
  However, choosing B is an option with a much smaller variance. Hence, i expect
  the other person to choose B, which is why i choose B, and so must all other
  "intelligent" people. B is a surer way of making "some" money.</span>

  Group a is in pan 1 and group b is in pan 2 of balance.<br>
  Since any one group will be heavier; let it be b in pan2 of balance i.e. pan2
  is heavier than pan1 at this time.<br>
  Now transfer a1a2a3 to pan 2, b1b2b3 out of pan2 and c1c2c3 to pan1. Now pan1
  has c1c2c3a4 and pan2 has a1a2a3b4.

  this is only possible when a1a2a3 are same as c1c2c3.<br>
  So, we are left with a4 and b4 which we can compare with any one of the correct
  balls to find the defective ball.

  present in the balance both pans contain correct balls and the balls removed
  i.e. b1b2b3 are containing the defective ball. Also earlier since the pan 2 was
  heavier and later it became equal to pan 1, it implies that the defective ball
  is heavy from rest of the balls.<br>
  Now weigh any two balls from b1b2b3 and if equal then the left out ball is
  defective else the heavier one.

  balance becomes reversed i.e. pan1 becomes heavier than pan2. Since pan1 was

  meaning a1a2a3 contain defective ball and also that the defective ball is

<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">Number of students = 20<br>
  Price of TV = 180
</p>
<p style="margin:6pt 0in 0.0001pt 8.5pt">Let no. of students = x and price = y.<br>
  So, y = (x<sup>2</sup>-2x)/2<br>
  and, 170&lt;y&lt;195.<br>
  =&gt; 1+√341&lt;x&lt;1+√391<br>
  =&gt; since x is integer, x=20.
